## 1. Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the global economy, including the United States. The widespread transmission of the virus and the subsequent implementation of measures to contain its spread, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing guidelines, have disrupted various sectors and caused significant economic disruptions. Analyzing the economic effects of COVID-19 is crucial in understanding the magnitude of the impact and formulating appropriate strategies for recovery and future resilience.

This data analysis project aims to examine the economic effects of COVID-19 on the United States by focusing on five major factors: GDP, employment, personal income, tax revenue, and home values. Each of these factors provides valuable insights into different aspects of the economy and helps us comprehend the overall impact of the pandemic.

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** is a vital measure of economic activity within a country. Analyzing GDP is essential in this case as it helps us assess the overall economic performance, including the contraction or expansion of the economy during the pandemic. By understanding the changes in GDP, we can evaluate the magnitude of the economic downturn and subsequent recovery.

**Employment** is another critical factor impacted by the pandemic. Examining employment levels provides valuable insights into the labor market's response to the crisis. Understanding the effects of COVID-19 on employment allows us to assess the extent of job losses, the industries most affected, and the subsequent implications for individuals and households.

**Personal income** is an important aspect to consider as it directly influences consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Analyzing changes in personal income helps us understand the impact of the pandemic on individuals' financial well-being, savings, and consumption patterns.

**Tax revenue** plays a crucial role in government finances and public services. Assessing the effects of COVID-19 on tax revenue helps us evaluate the fiscal impact on government budgets, identify potential areas of strain, and inform policy decisions related to revenue generation and expenditure priorities.

The **housing market**, represented by home values, has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Analyzing home values provides insights into the stability and resilience of the real estate sector, which has wide-ranging implications for homeowners, investors, and the overall economic outlook.

To achieve a comprehensive analysis, this project examines the changes in GDP throughout the pandemic, analyzes the effects of the pandemic on GDP and employment in selected sectors, explores the relationship between COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates, and examines all five factors at the state and regional levels. By taking this multi-faceted approach, we aim to gain a clear understanding of the economic changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and provide valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and individuals as they navigate the recovery and plan for the future.

## 2. Methodology:
1. Data Collection:
   - Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): The BEA provides data on GDP, personal income, and tax revenue. The data for each year includes information at the state and regional levels.
   - Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): The BLS offers data on employment, including the number of jobs and the unemployment rate. Similar to BEA, this data is available at the state and regional levels.
   - National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL): The NCSL provides relevant information on economic trends and policies at the state level.
   - Census: Census data is used to gather additional demographic and economic indicators that might influence the analysis.
   - Zillow: Zillow data is used to assess the housing market, including home prices, sales, and rental prices. This data is collected at the state and regional levels.
   
2. Time Period Selection:
   - Pre-Pandemic Period: The pre-pandemic period is defined as the median data from 2017,2018 and 2019. This baseline provides a reference point for comparison.
   - Pandemic Period: The pandemic period data is obtained from the median data of 2020 and 2021. This allows for an analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic.
   - Post-Pandemic Period: The post-pandemic data is collected from the data of 2022. This period represents the recovery phase following the pandemic.
   
3. Economic Regions:
   - Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): The analysis is conducted using the U.S. economic regions defined by the BEA. These regions include New England, Mideast, Southeast, Great Lakes, Plains, Rocky Mountains, Southwest, and Far West. Regional data enables comparisons and identification of regional trends.
   
4. Data Analysis Techniques:
   - Summary Statistics: Summary statistics are calculated to obtain key metrics, such as means, medians, and ranges.
   - Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis is performed to identify trends and patterns over time.
   
5. Calculating Change:
   - Change Rate Calculation: The change in the analysis refers to the rate of change from the previous year. It is calculated as the percentage difference between the values of a given year and the previous year. This helps measure the growth or decline of various economic indicators.

## Discussion:

## 3.2 Sector wise perfomance during pandemic

### Gross Output

The analysis of gross output data reveals the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various industries. Sectors such as Construction, Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, and Transportation and Warehousing experienced a decline in gross output during the pandemic, primarily due to disruptions in supply chains, reduced consumer spending, and business closures. However, there were sectors that demonstrated resilience and even growth in gross output, such as the Finance and Insurance industry. The Health Care and Social Assistance sector remained relatively stable, reflecting the essential nature of these services. These findings highlight the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic's impact on gross output across industries and emphasize the need for tailored strategies to support recovery and future growth in each sector.

### Number of Jobs

The analysis of the number of jobs data reveals the substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment across industries. Sectors such as Construction, Transportation and Warehousing, and Accommodation and Food Services experienced a significant decline in the number of jobs during the pandemic, primarily due to widespread closures, reduced consumer demand, and operational limitations. The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector were particularly hard hit, with a sharp decrease in job opportunities. On the other hand, industries like Health Care and Social Assistance demonstrated more resilience, with a relatively stable number of jobs, reflecting the essential nature of these services. The Finance and Insurance sector also showed a relatively positive trend, indicating the importance of financial stability during challenging times. These findings underscore the unequal impact of the pandemic on employment across sectors and emphasize the need for targeted policies and support measures to address job losses and facilitate recovery in the most affected industries.

In conclusion, Accommodation and Food Services, and Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sectors faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the Health Care and Social Assistance sector showed resilience. The Wholesale Trade and Finance and Insurance sectors experienced minimal impact. These insights highlight the varying degrees of vulnerability and adaptability across different sectors of the economy during the unprecedented crisis.

### 3.3 Impact of Covid-19 Cases and Deaths on Employment Nationally

Many businesses had to implement restrictions and closures to curb the spread of the COVID-19, leading to layoffs and reduced hiring activity. Consequently, the unemployment rate increased during these periods as more individuals were seeking job opportunities but struggled to find employment. However, as the rate of increase of cases deaths progressed, the employment rate actually improved steadily after their initial sharp decline.

Although there is an initial _correlation_ in the early stages of the pandemic, the progression of the data indicates that no direct relationship between Covid-19 case/death numbers and employment rates. It is likely that gpublic policy and private-sector responses to the pandemic were and continue to be main influencing factors on the employment rate. This highlights the ongoing struggle to balance public health measures and private business practices with economic stabilitys.

## 3.4 Regional Variations in Economic Impact

The provided summary statistics highlight various economic indicators and their changes across different states and economic regions during the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. By examining these findings, it becomes apparent that although the economic effects of COVID-19 varied among states, there are consistent changes at the economic region level.

### GDP Changes
The summary states that the change in GDP from the pre-pandemic to the pandemic exhibited diverse patterns across states, with some experiencing positive growth and others facing negative growth. However, there has been an overall improvement in GDP change from the pandemic to the post-pandemic period. This suggests that the negative impact of the pandemic on GDP was mitigated in the post-pandemic period. Additionally, the summary mentions that the regions exhibit consistent GDP changes over the years, indicating similar trends and patterns at the regional level.

### Employment Changes
Moving on to employment changes, it is noted that most states experienced negative employment changes during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. However, post-pandemic, there was a positive employment change, particularly in Nebraska, with significant improvement from the previous period. Furthermore, the summary mentions consistent employment changes across regions over the years. These findings indicate that although there were differences in employment changes among states during the pandemic, there is a convergence toward positive changes in employment at the regional level.

### Personal Income Changes
Regarding personal income, the summary states a slight positive change across all states during the pandemic, with slightly higher increases observed in Utah, Arizona, Idaho, and South Dakota. Post-pandemic, personal income shows a slight overall positive change in all states. Although there are variations among states, the summary highlights that the regional differences in changes are minimal, indicating consistent behavior across economic regions.

### Home Value Changes
When considering home values, it is mentioned that there are significant differences between states, with California and Hawaii leading in higher values. However, there has been an overall increase in home values across all states, particularly in Idaho, during the pandemic. Positive changes in home values were observed in all states, with higher rates in the post-pandemic period, especially in Arizona, Kansas, Florida, and Montana. The summary also points out that home value changes remained relatively consistent across all regions during the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Therefore, despite variations at the state level, there is consistency in the changes at the regional level.

### Tax Revenue Changes
Lastly, the tax revenue analysis shows that most states experienced a positive change from the pre-pandemic to the pandemic, with a few exceptions. Post-pandemic, all states exhibit a positive change in tax revenue, with Alaska experiencing a significant increase. The summary also highlights that the changes in tax revenue among regions were similar before the pandemic. However, the Far West and Rocky Mountain regions experienced significant increases during the pandemic, while the Great Lakes, Plains, New England, and Southeast regions showed moderate increases. Post-pandemic, the regions displayed much closer changes in tax revenue. These findings suggest that although there were differences among states during the pandemic, the regional level shows a convergence in tax revenue changes.

In conclusion, based on the provided summary statistics, it can be inferred that although the economic effects of COVID-19 varied among states, there are consistent changes at the economic region level. This indicates that the economic impact of the pandemic had a similar effect on the regions, leading to comparable changes in various economic indicators.

There are a few limitations to acknowledge in this data analysis project. Firstly, the inability to calculate the exact measure of error and standard error arises because the data comes from various sources that have not disclosed their error rates. Secondly, although most of the data used are derived from government sources, they are aggregated or summarized, restricting the assessment of statistical significance in the analysis. A further limitation relates to the scope of our data - we have not included demographics, which would likely provide insight into employment statistics specifically. These limitations can be addressed in future projects to delve deeper into statistical analysis.
